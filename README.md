# DFS Tool

DFS Tool is a command-line interface (CLI) utility for working with Area 51's DFS (Data File System) archive format. The DFS format is used to store game assets.

This C# implementation is based on the original C++ implementation by Inevitable Entertainment Inc, and attempts to 100% match the original implementation's behaviour, and complete features that were not implemented in the original implementation.

## Features

- Extract files from a DFS archive
- Create a new DFS archive from a directory of files
- Verify the integrity of a DFS archive
